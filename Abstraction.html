       <h2>Abstraction upon abstraction</h2>
       <p>Moving away from the concrete is like the first layer of abstraction. The next layer is what I may
          refer to as abstraction being ‘a kind of generilsation ’. I gave the example earlier of two pens
          but I could have easily chosen three, ten or a thousand pens. All these numbers 3,10,1000...
          e.tc., just like 2 are abstract objects. In an algebra class you learn that all numbers can be
          generalised by a single variable say x which can be seen as another step further away from our
          pens.
          An interesting case of this abstraction is in linear algebra which is the study finite dimensional
          vector spaces over a field. Ok, this is not the space for linear algebra nor is any prerequisite
          knowledge of it is required. A little knowledge of vectors encountered already in your physics,
          maths or computer science classes will suffice. In physics, a vector is a quantity with size and
          direction, go to computer science they will tell you a vector is a list of items and in mathematics
          an ordered list of numbers. This notion of a vector space over a field generalises all these
          instances and can be studied under one roof. Abstraction in this sense seeks to identify and
          define features that are common to different specialisations and possibilities. Another case is
          the Reimann integral which essentially gives the area under a continuous function is further
          generalised to the Lebsegue integral which in turn covers a larger class of functions.
          I could offer countless other examples but the overarching theme here is that a great deal of
          mathematical education is moving from one layer of abstraction to another.</p>

       <h2>Thinking from first principles</h2>
       <p>At this point we can appreciate the fact that abstraction seeks to remove details or lose
        information. This is the most powerful aspect of abstraction as it teaches one how to lose
        unnecessary or irrelevant information. Problems can be distilled to their essence, picking up the
        signal from the noise where others get paralysed. It is what physicists describe as thinking from
        first principles which can be contrasted by thinking by analogy. Novel problems require this sort
        of thinking. I will explore this feature of abstraction when looking at group theory – a branch of
        abstract algebra.</p>

        <h2>Abstract Algebra</h2>
        <p> In high school, the word “algebra” often means “finding solutions to equations.” This probably
            meant that you were solving linear equations, which look like
            <p class="center">
            ax + b = 0
            </p>
            <p class="center">
            or quadratic equations, of the form</p>
               
           <p class="center">ax2 + bx + c = 0</p> 
            <p>
            Methods for solving these equations were known even in ancient times. Indeed, you learned to
            solve quadratics by factoring, and also by the quadratic formula, which gives solutions in terms
            of square roots:
            You may have also learned to factor cubic polynomials, which have the form
            </p>
            <p class="center">
            ax3 + bx2 + cx + d
            </p>
    
            <p>
            Techniques were known to ancient mathematicians, including the Babylonians, for solving
            certain types of cubic equations. However, what about a general formula for the roots? Can we
            write down a formula, like the quadratic formula, which gives us the roots of any cubic in terms
            of square roots and cube roots? There is a formula, which we won’t write down here, but it
            took quite a longtime for mathematicians to find it. Later people started looking for solutions to
            a quartic and then later to a quintic and higher degree polynomials. In the early 19th century,
            two young mathematicians (Niels Henrik Abel and Evariste Galois) independently showed that
            there is no general formula for the roots of a quintic polynomial. <br><br>
            In proving that there is no “quintic formula,” Abel and Galois both essentially invented what is
            now known as a group. In particular, Galois studied groups of permutations of the roots of a
            polynomial. In short, he basically studied what happens when you “shuffle” the roots of the
            polynomial around. Galois’ ideas led to a whole field called Galois theory, which allows one to
            determine whether any given polynomial has a solution in terms of radicals. Galois theory is
            regarded as one of the most beautiful branches of mathematics, and it usually makes up a
            whole course on its own. This is the context in which groups (in their current form) began to
            arise. Since then, the study of groups has taken off in many directions, and has become quite
            interesting in its own right. Groups are used to study permutations, symmetries, and
            cryptography, to name a few things. We’ll start off by studying groups abstractly, and we will
            consider interesting examples of groups along the way. Hopefully this discussion will give you
            an idea of where groups come from, and where your study of algebra can eventually lead.
            Group theory
            We will define groups (and other algebraic structures) via a set of desirable axioms, and we will
            then try to logically deduce properties of groups from these axioms.<br><br>

            To give you a preview, let me say the following regarding group theory. A group will basically be
            a set (often consisting of numbers, or perhaps matrices, but also of other objects) with some
            sort of operation on it that is designed to play the role of addition or multiplication.
            Additionally, we’ll require that the operation has certain desirable arithmetic properties. In the
            second part of the course, we will study objects called rings. These will arise when we allow for
            two different operations on a set, with the requirement that they interact well (via a
            distributive property). Along the way, we will try to do as many examples as possible. Some will
            come from things that are familiar to you (such as number systems and linear algebra), but
            some will be totally new. In particular, we will emphasize the role of groups in the study of
            symmetry. <br><br>
            Despite the concrete examples, there will still be an overarching theme of classification and
            structure. That is, once we’ve defined things such as groups and rings and proven some facts
            about them, we’ll try to answer much broader questions. Namely, we’ll try to determine when
            two groups are the same (a concept called isomorphism), and when we can break a group
            down into smaller groups. This idea of classification is something that occurs in pretty much
            every branch of math (algebra, topology, analysis, etc.). It may seem overly abstract, but it is
            paramount to the understanding of algebra. <br><br>
            We will start off slowly in our abstract approach to algebra—we’ll begin with a couple of
            motivating examples that should already be familiar to you. Then we’ll study one which is more
            interesting, and perhaps less familiar. Once we’ve done these, we’ll write down the actual
            definition of a group and begin to study these objects from an “abstract” viewpoint.</p>
