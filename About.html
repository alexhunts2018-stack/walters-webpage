       <h2>About This Site</h2>
       <p>We are a small tutoring company located at the heart of Oxford. Our goal is to assist and
          prepare students who want to pursue mathematics, engineering or a course with high utility of
          mathematics get offers from top universities.
          We believe that mainstream mathematical pedagogy has essentially been reduced to “teach to
          pass exams “, hence so much emphasis on the tricks, step by step memorization of solving
          mathematical problems. Consequently, more students are achieving high grades in the subject,
          yet come short when it comes to problem solving which is a major discriminating factor when
          applying to top universities.
          A paradigm shift to focusing on how to conceptualise and solve problems mathematically while
          getting computers to do the calculating should be the new normal in the pedagogy of
          mathematics. The mathematician Conrad Wolfram addresses this issue better than I will ever
          do and has a dedicated website</p>
