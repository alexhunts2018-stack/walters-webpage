       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>I have a vivid memory from school of my maths teacher asking me if I would consider being a
        teacher to which my grimacing face could tell a thousand NOs. The irony is not only the
        creation of this website but my passion to teach mathematics and sharing its hidden beauty is
        genuine and pure.
        Why genuine?
        I am sick and tired of the justification (especially from politicians) citing the utility of the subject
        or its significance in the modern economy. I personally believe this has had the unintended
        consequence of destroying the beauty and soul of the subject where the pedagogy of
        mathematics is akin to robots crunching algorithms, completely devoid of the human spirit. In
        Hardy’s ‘a mathematician apology’ the only justification mathematics need is the same for that
        of art or music.
        I have a BEng in Chemical Engineering (2011) from Birmingham University UK and an MSc in
        Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing from Oxford (2015). In addition, I have had
        the opportunity to work across various fields from finance, machine learning and of course my
        favourite which has been tutoring.</p>
